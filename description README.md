PORTOFOLIO PROJECT

Objective: The goal of the portfolio website is to present ourselves to the world. It contains mainly 3 pages. An “about me” page that is just a brief introduction to who the author is. A portfolio page that showcases the different projects the author may have worked on alone or in teams. Finally, a contact me page where you can reach out to the author.

Tools: We mainly built the website using CSS, HTML and bootstrap. Each page is designed with a simple 4-layer grid: a horizontal row for the header, 2 columns for content and a horizontal row for the footer. The exception is the index page which features 3 columns.

Responsiveness: We ensured the page is responsive by implementing a viewport meta data in the head section of each HTML document. We also took advantage of media queries options offered by CSS bootstrap. As required by the project the page will cover the entire width on extra small device and may have margins on smaller ones.

NavBar: The design also features a vertical Navbar to the right of each HTML page
